# Udacity Casting Agency (FSND Capstone Project)

Udacity Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies.

## Motivation
I developed this project to practice and solidify the concepts I've learned in Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

The topics include but are not limited to:
- Relational Database Architecture Modeling with PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy.
- HTTP Protocol and Methods.
- API Development with Flask.
- Authentication and Authorization using third-party services such as **Auth0**
- Role-Based Access Control in Flask.
- Application Deployment using Hosting Services such as **AWS** or **Heroku**

## API Technology Stack and package dependencies
The technology stack and required packages can be found in `requirements.txt`, but most notable dependencies are:
- Python 3.7+
- PostgreSQL Server Database.
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Migrate
- Flask-CORS
- python-dotenv

## Remote Setup
The live application is hosted on [https://aqueous-eyrie-91349.herokuapp.com/](https://aqueous-eyrie-91349.herokuapp.com/)
### Deployment Instructions

- Create an applicaton using Heroku's CLI
```
heroku create <app_name>
```
- Add PostgreSQL Server Add-on to the application.
```
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --app <app_name>
```
- Configure Config Variables through Application Dashboard on Heroku.

- Deploy the application with Heroku
```
git push heroku main
```
- Apply database migrations.
```
heroku run python manage.py db upgrade --app <app_name>
```
- Establish a psql session with the remote database
```
heroku pg:psql
```
- Apply a script to seed the database
```
\i seed_after_migration.sql
```
You can now exit and test the application endpoints.
## Local Setup
To get the project working locally, you will need to create a virtual environment.
```
python -m venv venv
```
Then activate the virtual environment depending on your operating system.

Windows `./venv/Scripts/activate`

Linux/macOS `source venv/bin/activate`

Install the required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The project uses two local databases:
- `CastingAgencyDB` which is the main database that runs the application.
- `TestCastingAgencyDB` which is a database used for testing purposes.

Create the tables.
```
createdb CastingAgencyDB
createdb TestCastingAgencyDB
```

Apply database migrations to create tables`python manage.py db upgrade
`  *Note*: Migrations are only applied on `CastingAgencyDB`

**Seeding the database**

- The migrations are only applied to `CastingAgencyDB` database, after applying the migrations you can run `psql CastingAgencyDB <  seed_after_migration.sql`
- Since migrations aren't applied on the testing database, no tables are created, thus we can create the tables and seed the database by running a different SQL script that creates the tables before seeding: `psql TestCastingAgencyDB < seed_for_testing.sql` 

Start the flask application by running the command `flask run`

## Testing

The project contains two test suites:
- RBAC tests in the postman collection `Casting Agency.postman_collection.json` (Remote testing by default, unless **host** variable is changed in the collection to localhost:5000)
- API Endpoints tests in `test_app.py`

To run the RBAC tests, just import the collection in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and run it.

**Note**: The delete test on Postman isn't idempotent, i.e. an item can only be deleted once then the test will fail, unless the *<item_id>* is changed.

 To run the  API endpoints tests in `test_app.py` You can run either of those commands:
- `python -m unittest` 
- `pytest`  (requires `pytest` to be installed).

## Authentication (Using Auth0)
Udacity Casting Agency has 3 roles:
- **Casting Assistant**
	- Permissions
		- `get:movies`
		- `get:actors`
- **Casting Director**
	 - Permissions
		- `get:movies`
		- `get:actors`
